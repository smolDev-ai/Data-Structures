Terminology
Cache Hit: When the data you want is in the cache
Cache Miss: When you gave to go to primary storage to get the data
LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)
Cache has a limited size
LRU Cache discards the least recently used item in teh cache, when the cache is full
Sructs needed:
Hash Table: Need to be able to look something up with a key. Hash table will allow us to quickly look up cache
            entries by key
Doubly Linked List: Need to organize our data in least and most recently used data.
    - The DLL makes it easy to move data to the head O(1)
    - The DLL makes it easy to remove data from the tail O(1)
Most recently used: Most recently read or most recently added to the cache.
Least Recnely used: This will be discarded, the tail holds the least recently used item
Adding entries to the cache:
    - if the data exists
        - Check the hash with the provided key to see if the key is a key in the hash
        - Move the new entry to the head of the list
    - if not
        - If the hash is full, then we need to remove the tail (return del node)
        - Delete the tail pointer from hash table (ref del node for this)
        - create a new node in the list (return new node addr)
        - create a KVP in the hash that points to the new node (use created node addr)
    - finally
        - create a new node in the DLL (return new node addr)
        - Add Hash table entry that holds a pointer to the new DLL node (use created node addr)
    - return the found / new item
Get Item from the cache:
    - Ref steps above ^^^^
    - Return the node from setter fn (steps above)
Remove Item from the cache:
    - If the cache is overfull, delete the tail, return the removed node
    - Remove the tail pointer from the hash table wher KVP value == removed node value
